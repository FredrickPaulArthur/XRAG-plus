XRAG+ : Hybrid Retrieval and Tool-Augmented Verification for Robust Cross-Lingual Generation

## Description
XRAG+ is a multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that I designed and implemented from scratch. It ingests large-scale multilingual corpora such as Wikipedia dumps, preprocesses them, and indexes them for hybrid retrieval. A Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) generation module produces language-aware answers by fusing cross-lingual evidence. The project includes a complete evaluation framework, ablations, and reproducible scripts. XRAG+ demonstrates my ability to perform independent research, design complex AI systems, and engineer scalable ML pipelines.
